This gem was found after being parked in a climate controlled garage for 50 years! Yes, the first question is, WHO DOES THAT? The owner we bought this vehicle took ONE trip in his 75 year life out of the state of Iowa after visiting Disneyland in southern California. that ‘s right he canceled his round trip ticket air flight to jump in this car and drive it back. After bringing it home to Iowa his dream was to convert this car to a gasser drag car. Of course that was a bad idea, so instead he packed it in the back of his garage. Because his passion was drag racing he never had time for this 55’ Bel Air Convertible. Wait, the story gets better! Always believing he would one day restore the car, he asked his kids to buy him parts for Christmas, nearly all OEM parts. That’s right! The new owner of this car has nearly all new parts, exterior and interior making all his car needs, is the soft trim. The epic 55’ Bel Air is equipped with power steering, power brakes, power windows, and power seats. It’s loaded! The car has only rust in the rear quarters and that’s it!

This gem was found after being parked in a climate controlled garage for 50 years! Yes, the first question is, WHO DOES THAT? The owner we bought this vehicle took ONE trip in his 75 year life out of the state of Iowa after visiting Disneyland in southern California. that ‘s right he canceled his round trip ticket air flight to jump in this car and drive it back. After bringing it home to Iowa his dream was to convert this car to a gasser drag car. Of course that was a bad idea, so instead he packed it in the back of his garage. Because his passion was drag racing he never had time for this 55’ Bel Air Convertible. Wait, the story gets better! Always believing he would one day restore the car, he asked his kids to buy him parts for Christmas, nearly all OEM parts. That’s right! The new owner of this car has nearly all new parts, exterior and interior making all his car needs, is the soft trim. The epic 55’ Bel Air is equipped with power steering, power brakes, power windows, and power seats. It’s loaded! The car has only rust in the rear quarters and that’s it!

In 1968 this Mustang was bought from Earnhardt Ford in Arizona. The car's primary owner was U.S. Serviceman stationed in Europe. He drove this car as a daily driver, and it saw many hours on the German Autobahn.

Extremely rare “1 of 1 of 1”. This means is that it is a California Special, a GT, and it has a 4 speed 390 with air. What makes this car a great highway driver and proven on the Autobahn, is that it has a 3.0 limited slip rear axle, (tall gears) resulting in much better gas mileage for its day, but still had serious horsepower.

This vehicle has a Marti Report.
